Dear Diary,

Today was a tough day. Sarah and Jane barely spoke to each other, and I could feel the tension between them. It's hard to see my two friends not getting along. I tried talking to both of them separately, but they were both so stubborn. Sarah kept saying that Jane was being fake, and Jane felt like Sarah was overreacting. I wish they could just sit down and have an honest conversation to sort things out, but it seems like they're not ready for that yet.

In the meantime, I've been feeling caught in the middle. Whenever I hang out with one of them, the other seems distant or hurt. It's a difficult situation for me, and I'm not sure how to handle it. I don't want to choose sides, but I also want to support both of my friends. It's putting a strain on our friendship triangle, and it's taking a toll on me too.

On top of all that, schoolwork is piling up. I have that huge paper due for AP English, and I feel overwhelmed with all the research I need to do. I wish I could focus better, but the tension between Sarah and Jane is constantly on my mind. I hope things get better soon. I miss the carefree days when we were all just friends without any drama.

I'll try to take some time for myself tonight, maybe read a book or watch a movie to take my mind off things. I need a break from all this emotional turmoil.

Goodnight,

Kate
