Dear Diary,

It's been a few days since I last wrote, and things are still complicated. Sarah and Jane are still not talking much, and it feels like our group dynamic has completely shifted. I miss the laughter and fun we used to have. It's strange how a small misunderstanding can have such a big impact on our friendship.

I've been trying my best to maintain a neutral position and be there for both of them, but it's exhausting. I wish they could see that they're both at fault in some way and just forgive each other. I've suggested sitting down and talking it out, but they both seem resistant to the idea. It's frustrating because I want to help them, but they need to be willing to work things out too.

In the midst of all this, my schoolwork is suffering. I barely have any motivation to study or complete my assignments. My mind is preoccupied with thoughts of Sarah and Jane. I need to find a way to focus on my own goals and not let their issues consume me. It's easier said than done, though.

I'm considering talking to a trusted teacher or counselor about the situation. Maybe they can offer some guidance or advice on how to navigate these friendship challenges. It's important for me to prioritize my mental well-being and find a way to manage the stress.

I hope that one day we can all look back at this and laugh, realizing how silly it was to let a misunderstanding come between us. But until then, I'll continue to do my best and hope for a resolution.

Sending tired but hopeful vibes,

Kate
